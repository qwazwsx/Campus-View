# Campus-View

![](/images/main.png?raw=true)

Campus View lets you import your courses and assignments from Infinite Campus automatically. You can then add assignments and edit previous assignments to preview how they would affect your grade. As you can see here, I've added an assignment called `Final` with a score of `45` of `50` points. Campus View then automatically calculates how this affects your final grade.

You can see here that Campus View uses your schools letter grading system to see exactly how close you are to the next letter grade. In this example, this classes grade is only `.96%` away from a B.

Logging in is easy! Simply enter your Infinite Campus information and Campus View does the rest. Your password is encrypted and sent to Infinite Campus, and is not stored on Campus View servers.

The breakdown feature shows how different scores on an assignment will affect your final score. In this example, I need atleast `12/15` or an `80%` to maintain an A in the class.

Campus View is in a closed beta at the moment. Once more improvements have been made the code will be open sourced and the website will be made public.
